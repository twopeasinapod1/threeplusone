            <p>Art and the artist sourrounds us. &ldquo;Three Plus One&rdquo; is intended to highlight just that in its outlook. 
            It not meant to address anyone one class of individual or artist. 
            It showcases the elements that is available to us all; elements that either invokes our &ldquo;five sense&rdquo; giving to us a sensory-expereince. 
            Perhaps, even also to an invisible, innate, other-worldly expereince. That ranges from the most gentle to the most hostile. 
            Sometimes it ventures into the beauty of life and other times to the most grotesque and macabre. 
            However expressed it showcases our inspiration, our perceptions and eventually our true selves as learned expressed visibly.

            This website is intended to be &ldquo;a work of art&rdquo;. 
            Instead of visiting an art gallery at a museum you are visiting the &ldquo;World Wide Web&rdquo; (www) a virtual space and place that rivals any art gallery. 
            Here works of art are displayed for the whole world to the whole world.
            </p>

            The universe and its elements at times can be counted in threes such as &ldquo;sun, moon, stars&rdquo; these three exist as part of a whole. 
            They exist in a part of the universe we can safely refer to as space. However, they are counted as part of the known universe in which we live.
            There is also another three and yet another, along with more others that continued to be counted in threes.
            They all exist with purpose and operate within their individual purpose and at times a shared or common purpose.
            In other words they stand alone yet co-exist.
            </p>

            A work of art for all people of all the earth and time.
            The elements of the universe exist for all and from time memorial have sustained all from the birth living and dying till they return to the elements is all their form they become one with it once more.
            The universe and its elements do not depend on its inhabitants the plus one to exist. However, the plus one have a total dependence for existence and being on the universe. That is their physical existence.
            Plus One is incomplete in existence when not in the universe who sustains its existence.
            The universe was created to sustain its existence.
            *the universe was created for its existence and not it for the universe&apos;s existence.
            </p>
            <p>
            As you visit its pages as intended they tell a story.  A story titled &ldquo;Three Plus One&rdquo;. The One is the common denominators of all the threes.
            </p>
